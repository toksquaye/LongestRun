Description : a function that finds the zero-based index of the longest run in a string.

A run is a consecutive sequence of the same character. 
If there is more than one run with the same length, return the index of the first one.
For example, IndexOfLongestRun("abbcccddddcccbba") should return 6 as the longest run is dddd and it first appears on index 6.
